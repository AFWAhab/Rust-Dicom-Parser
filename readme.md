This is my implementation of the dicom standard. I know that there already exists some libraries out there, that does this, but to be honest, i had a great desire in visualization, and learning about medical imaging, and at the same time i wanted to learn how to use RUST. I had already worked a bit with dicom and VTK in C++ with a QT setup, but again, i wanna learn rust, and i wanna learn how to manipulate this imaging standard properly. So this why i made this.
